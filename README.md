# Readable: A Content and Comment App

A React.js content and comment web application built with `redux` and `react-router` that allows you to post content to predefined categories, comment on posts, and vote on posts and comments. You can also edit and delete posts and comments.

Readable was created for the final assessment project for the **Udacity's Redux course**.

## Quickstart

Clone the repository and install dependecies. Run the development server using `npm start`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oberfrank-rezso/readable
$ cd readable
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

**Important** This project assumes that you are running the [api-server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/) provided by the course instructors on localhost:3001.

## Acknowledgments

Most importantly, thanks to the instuctors at Udacity! I've read a lot of posts and watched countless videos on the way, I couldn't list them all even if I set out to and I don't want any author to feel left out.
